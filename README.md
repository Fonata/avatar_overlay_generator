# avatar_overlay_generator

A tool to place overlays over social media avatars.

## Purpose

The software in this repository lets end-users add an optical overlay to their social media pictures or photos. This
makes sense to advertise events such as the [AugustRiseUp in Berlin](https://augustriseup.de/), for which I created this
software.

## Hosted version

This repoâ€™s software runs at https://klimainitiativen.info/avatar_generator

## Installation

This repository forms a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) module. To use it, you need a working Drupal 8 or 9 instance.

You can install the module using Composer by executing the following:

```bash
composer require fonata/avatar_overlay_generator
drush en avatar_overlay_generator
```

Now, the URLs defined in `avatar_overlay_generator.routing.yml` will be served by your Drupal instance.

## Configuration for Drupal

There are no configuration options.

## Extending the module

The most important task is to add more overlays

1. Create an `.svg` file and a `.png` file with the same name. The .svg will be used as the overlay and the .png as a
   preview.
2. Place both files in proper `overlays` subdirectory of your server.
3. If you want to give the overlays back to the community, create a pull request
   at https://github.com/Fonata/avatar_overlay_generator/pulls
